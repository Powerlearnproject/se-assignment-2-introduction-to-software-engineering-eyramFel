 b. and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering vs. programming often work together or adjacent to one another, and their departments are often in constant communication with each other. The main difference between the two roles is that software engineering focuses more broadly on the software, using complex computer science and engineering to construct the structure of the software. Programmers focus only on the technical coding, or writing, of the software itself.
The difference between Software Engineering and Traditional Programming?
Programmers have a narrower focus than software engineers. Programmers write code to instruct software programs how and when to execute specific functions to deliver on a predetermined set of outcomes. Programmers often work with a head software engineer, who delegates tasks to programmers based on their specific skill set. Here are a few responsibilities and duties a programmer may have:
•	Maintaining comprehensive knowledge of a variety of software languages, such as Java, Python, C++, and SQL
•	Performing maintenance on established software programs and creating new software infrastructure
•	Ensuring the code is free from bugs and issues before sending it to the engineer for further testing
•	Building code libraries to optimize the coding process for current and future projects
•	Responding to customer demands in a timely manner
•	Updating logs and shared documents so other software teams can access the project if they need to

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
 

SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.
1. Waterfall Model
It is the fundamental model of the software development life cycle. This is a very simple model. The waterfall model is not in practice anymore, but it is the basis for all other SDLC models. Because of its simple structure, the waterfall model is easier to use and provides a tangible output. In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed, and due to this less flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore. 
2. Agile Model
The agile model in SDLC was mainly designed to adapt to changing requests quickly. The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. The agile model refers to a group of development processes. These processes have some similar characteristics but also possess certain subtle differences among themselves.







Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:
Let’s delve into the differences between Agile and Waterfall models of software development:
1.	Agile:
o	Flexibility and Iteration: Agile emphasizes continuous feedback and adaptation. It’s a dynamic approach where requirements evolve over time.
o	Sprints: Work is divided into time-based bursts called Sprints (typically one-to-four weeks). Each Sprint delivers value to the customer/user.
o	Self-Organizing Teams: Agile teams decide how to allocate resources to meet requirements, consulting with stakeholders when needed.
o	Collaboration: Agile promotes ongoing collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
o	Preferred Scenarios: Agile suits projects with evolving requirements, frequent changes, and a need for rapid delivery.
2.	Waterfall:
o	Sequential and Rigid: Waterfall follows distinct phases (e.g., planning, design, development, testing) completed in order. Each stage must finish before the next begins.
o	Thorough Planning: Waterfall focuses on detailed planning upfront, minimizing changes during execution.
o	Linear Process: Projects proceed linearly from requirements to final release or project completion.
o	Preferred Scenarios: Waterfall is suitable for well-defined, stable requirements, where predictability and thorough documentation matter.
In summary, Agile is adaptive, collaborative, and ideal for evolving projects, while Waterfall is structured, planned, and best for stable requirements
